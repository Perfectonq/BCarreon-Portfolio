               <h2>Hello, My Name is <span>Brayden!</span></h2>
               <p>I'm a 17 year old kid that just wants to do what is fun to me. I'm currently a junior in highschool and started coding with Visual Studio about 3 months ago.
               To be honest I really don't know when I started, kinda just picked it up. At first I've always dreamt of going to the NBA but just the lack of confidence, 
               I don't think it'll happen, but I stay with my chin up and push through. Was never that type of kid to give up, and just let god himself create my path. 
               Follow me on this journey as I keep this updated!</p>

          <div class="text"><p>
               I started my coding jounrey with game hacking. Yes GAME HACKING. Call me what you want,
               we've all wanted to do it when we were younger on XBox 360 or PS3. I started modding in 2017 with premade cheats
               but actually started making my own in 2023, early 2024 using Cheat Engine and then it all began. I started creating UIs with cheat engine's
               form interface and lua scripting, then I got hooked. Same mods but different Tool UIs, because I've always had a creative mind when it came to
               designing something that I wanted to design. I then started actual coding this year with Visual Studio 2022 and here we are now!

          <div class="WID"><p>
             Im currently a junior in highschool if you didn't already see. I play basketball and have been for 7 years now.
             I started getting into wakeboarding and have been addicted to it but sadly that time is limited and can't go everyday.
             I go to the gym to workout or play basketball and when I'm at home, I play video games with friends or alone and make personal projects
             like this one. I'm not a very interesting type of guy but Im cool to be around unless I annoy you of course. Whenever I learn something like coding
             I get hooked instantly because of the accomplishment you get from doing something even if it's so small. You can check out my personal projects <a href="Videos.html" target="_blank"><span>here!</span></a> Oh, I have two pugs [Gemma & Jax]

          <h2>What I Want to do</h2>

          <div class="WIWTD"><p>
               Honestly, I'm not entirely sure where life will take me, but I just leave it in gods hands. I do plan on going to college and advance my learning in Software Engineering/Development and
               hopefully turn it into a career. Like I said, there is just something about making user interfaces that makes me enjoy it. I do like simplicity and
               like keeping it clean. I am making this to showcase my work for that oppurtunity to get a job in the coding department. Just another reason I want to become a Software Engineer
               is because I can just sit at a computer screen, and as much as that sucks. I already do that to be honest, just with video games. So might aswell make it my job. And who knows I might teach myself how to game develop, but
               I just know that is way to complex from where Im at right now. Moral of this message is I just want a good job and something that I actually enjoy. Sometimes. Gets annoying having to deal with errors or unfunctional things, but
               thats the love of the game and why I wanna do it. It sucks doing but there is a bigger reward in the end.
